# hacktoberfest-for-beginners

This is a project for the beginners to get started with open source contribution and participate in Hacktoberfest. I have also written some blogs to help people learn how to contribute to open source. Please find the links at the bottom of this page.

**Note:** This repository is only for beginners who don't know much about git and how to use GitHub platform. The only aim for creating this project was to help such people so that not only they learn how to use git but also earn cool prizes during this contest.

**In any way, I do not promote spamming any public repositories just to earn a T-Shirt during this hacktoberfest contest. I request all of you who have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub platform to do some useful contribute in some open source projects.**

# What is hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, a student learning to code, an event host, or a company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## How can a beginner participate?

If you’re new to open source (everyone was once!), take a look at our

[Introduction to Open Source series.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source)
Before you make your first contribution, you should familiarize yourself with [How To Create a Pull Request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

The following resources share repositories that curate tasks for beginners:

- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

- [Issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/)

- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/)

- [Awesome for Beginners](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-beginners)

Once you start feeling more comfortable, you can find more open source projects through the following programs:

- [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)

- [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)

- [This is another great guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) outlining ways you can contribute to open source.

## Event details

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Participation rules

To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt.

## Quality standards

In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), here are examples of the PRs that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

- PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

- PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR)

- PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October

- Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.

## Values

Inspired by you – the community – through your actions and stories.

- Everyone is welcome! Hacktoberfest participants have represented 151 countries and thousands of unique skill sets. Our program welcomes everyone already in the open source software community – and anyone interested in diving in.

- Quantity is fun, quality is key! Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building. And it all begins with meaningful contributions to open source technology.

- Short-term actions, long-term impact! In the open source community, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. Your participation has a lasting effec
